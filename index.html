                                            Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son
                                            determined to
                                            earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has
                                            long
                                            defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.

                                            With revenge against the Gods of Olympus in the past, Kratos now lives in
                                            the
                                            realm of Norse deities and monsters.

                                            It is in this harsh and merciless world that he must fight to surtive as he
                                            teaches his son to do the same and tries to stop him from repeating the
                                            cruel
                                            mistakes of the Ghost of Sparta.

                                        <p>Atreus is a happy and curious child who is kind to others when he engages in
                                            conversation with them, believing that he should help people whether they be
                                            living or dead. He is fond of exploring and learning Norse mythology,
                                            particularly from Mimir and Freya.</p>

                                        <p>When he was a child, Atreus learned various Norse languages and hunting from
                                            his
                                            mother. However, his gentle disposition initially made him hesitant to take
                                            a
                                            life, whether it was an innocent deer or a troll that attacked his father.
                                            Despite this, Atreus constantly tries to prove to his father that he can
                                            handle
                                            himself.</p>

                                            One of the most interesting giants from Norse mythology is the giantess
                                            Angrboda, whose name means ‘bringer of grief’. But she was far from a simple
                                            force for grief, and as the consort of Loki is one of the most important
                                            mothers
                                            in Nose mythology, bearing three of the most fearsome creatures from Norse
                                            myth.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>While she's never seen in the game, Jörmungandr's Jötunn Shrine specifically
                                            names her in Elder Futhark, alongside her two other children Hel and Fenrir.
                                            It's possible that she survived the genocide of the giants by Aesir Gods
                                            since
                                            both of her sons Jörmungandr and Fenrir are alive and well even though her
                                            present whereabouts are currently unknown.</p>

                                        <p>nitially, Freya is very friendly, hospitable, and at times motherly towards
                                            Atreus, taking care of him when his illness had become worse and his father
                                            had
                                            set out to retrieve a cure. She was friendly towards Kratos, despite the
                                            latter's open distrust of virtually everyone and hatred for gods.</p>

                                        <p>It is implied that Freya sees herself in Kratos and that this is why she
                                            decided
                                            to help him, although she also teases "or maybe I just like you". It is
                                            unknown
                                            which of these answers is true, but she is shown to care for Atreus, both as
                                            a
                                            friend and as a mother-figure of sorts. </p>

                                        earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has

                                    <p>Atreus is a happy and curious child who is kind to others when he engages in
                                        conversation with them, believing that he should help people whether they be
                                        living or dead. He is fond of exploring and learning Norse mythology,
                                        particularly from Mimir and Freya.</p>

                                    <p>When he was a child, Atreus learned various Norse languages and hunting from
                                        his
                                        mother. However, his gentle disposition initially made him hesitant to take
                                        a
                                        life, whether it was an innocent deer or a troll that attacked his father.
                                        Despite this, Atreus constantly tries to prove to his father that he can
                                        handle
                                        himself.</p>

                                        One of the most interesting giants from Norse mythology is the giantess
                                        Angrboda, whose name means ‘bringer of grief’. But she was far from a simple
                                        force for grief, and as the consort of Loki is one of the most important
                                        mothers
                                        in Nose mythology, bearing three of the most fearsome creatures from Norse
                                        myth.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>While she's never seen in the game, Jörmungandr's Jötunn Shrine specifically
                                        names her in Elder Futhark, alongside her two other children Hel and Fenrir.
                                        It's possible that she survived the genocide of the giants by Aesir Gods
                                        since
                                        both of her sons Jörmungandr and Fenrir are alive and well even though her
                                        present whereabouts are currently unknown.</p>

                                    <p>nitially, Freya is very friendly, hospitable, and at times motherly towards

                                        set out to retrieve a cure. She was friendly towards Kratos, despite the
                                        latter's open distrust of virtually everyone and hatred for gods.</p>

                                    <p>It is implied that Freya sees herself in Kratos and that this is why she

                                        to help him, although she also teases "or maybe I just like you". It is

                                        which of these answers is true, but she is shown to care for Atreus, both as

                                        friend and as a mother-figure of sorts. </p>
